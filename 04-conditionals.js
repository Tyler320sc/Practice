11. Print 'Exact amount!' when the wallet contains the exact amount for the price. Print 'More than enough.' when there is more than enough money in the wallet. Print 'Not enough money.' when there is not enough money in the wallet.

Notice that the wallet is in cents and the price is in dollars, so you'll have to do a bit of work to compare them.
